Welcome to the GA Peach AI Twin Generator — a simple AI image generator that lets users create their own “AI Twin” by entering a text prompt.

🚀 How It Works

Enter a prompt describing your AI Twin (e.g., "a confident woman in peach tones wearing futuristic fashion").

The app sends your prompt to the OpenAI DALL·E model using a secure Google Cloud Function.

The image is generated and displayed on your screen.
