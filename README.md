## 🚀 How It Works

1. Users enter a description of their desired AI Twin  
   *(example: “a confident peach-toned AI woman with futuristic style”)*  
2. The prompt is sent securely to a **serverless backend**  
3. An AI image is generated and returned to the user  
4. The image is displayed instantly on the webpage

The backend ensures API keys remain private and secure.
